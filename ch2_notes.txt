A vector space consist of:
1. a field F of scalars
2. a set V of objects, called vectors
3. vector addition  and scalar multiplication rules are satisfied.

Examples:
1. the n-tuple space
2. the space of mxn matrices
3. the space of functions from a set to a field
4. the space of polynomial functions over a field F
5. the field C of complex numbers over the field of real numbers

If B = c1*A1+c2*A2+....+cn*An for A,B be any 2 vectors in V and c1....cn be scalars in F, then B is said to be a linear combination of A in V.

//some parts which are covered in this chapter but I am not going to define them here
Geometric interpretation of vector addition and vector multiplication.

Subspaces: A subspace of vector space V is a subset W of V which is itself a vector space over the field F with operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication on V.
Note: For subspaces, the commutative and associative properties need not be checked.
Example:
1. zero-subspace
2. Hermitian matrix is not a subspace of all nxn matrices over C.
3. The solution space of a system of homogeneous linear equations.

Intersection of any collection of subspaces of V is a subspace of V.
