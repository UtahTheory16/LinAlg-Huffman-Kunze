A vector space consist of:
1. a field F of scalars
2. a set V of objects, called vectors
3. vector addition  and scalar multiplication rules are satisfied.

Examples:
1. the n-tuple space
2. the space of mxn matrices
3. the space of functions from a set to a field
4. the space of polynomial functions over a field F
the field C of complex numbers
